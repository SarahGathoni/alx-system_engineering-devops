Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Challenge

Summary:
During the web stack debugging challenge, we assessed the performance of our web server setup using Nginx under high load. Unfortunately, the results revealed a significant number of failed requests. The benchmarking tool ApacheBench was utilized to simulate HTTP requests to the server, with a configuration of 2000 requests and 100 requests concurrently. Out of these, 943 requests failed. The primary objective of this postmortem is to identify the root causes behind the failed requests and propose necessary steps to rectify the issues.

Timeline:

Load testing using ApacheBench: 2000 requests with 100 concurrent requests.
943 requests failed to complete successfully.
Task escaleted to: the devops team

Root Causes and Analysis:

Insufficient server resources: One of the potential causes for the high rate of failed requests could be inadequate server resources. When the server lacks sufficient memory, processing power, or network bandwidth, it may struggle to handle the incoming requests effectively. This can result in timeouts, connection errors, or other failures. Further investigation is required to determine if resource constraints were contributing to the issue.

Configuration issues with Nginx: Improper configuration settings within Nginx might have adversely impacted its performance. It is crucial to review the Nginx configuration files, including settings related to worker processes, connection limits, and timeouts. Inaccurate configurations can lead to degraded performance, connection drops, and request failures.

Insufficient worker processes: Nginx relies on worker processes to handle incoming requests. If the number of worker processes is not adequately configured, it can limit the server's ability to handle concurrent requests. A lower number of worker processes than required may result in request queuing, increased response time, and potential request failures.

Backend server issues: The failed requests might be indicative of problems with the backend server or application. Insufficient resources, bottlenecks in the application code, or database connection issues can all contribute to request failures. It is essential to examine the logs and metrics of the backend server to identify any issues that might have affected its ability to handle requests successfully.

Insufficient logging and monitoring: In the initial assessment, the focus on logs and monitoring might not have been extensive enough. Detailed logs provide valuable insights into the behavior of the web server and can help identify errors, warnings, and performance bottlenecks. Enhancing the logging and monitoring capabilities can enable better troubleshooting and faster issue resolution.

Resolution Steps:

Conduct a thorough analysis of server resources: Evaluate the server's resource allocation, including memory, CPU, and network bandwidth. Determine if the existing resources are adequate to handle the expected load. If necessary, consider upgrading the server or optimizing the resource allocation.

Review and optimize Nginx configuration: Carefully examine the Nginx configuration files and ensure they are correctly set up for the desired workload. Pay particular attention to worker processes, connection limits, timeouts, and other relevant settings. Make adjustments based on best practices and performance requirements.

Adjust worker processes: Determine the appropriate number of worker processes based on the server's hardware capabilities and the expected workload. Balancing the number of worker processes can help improve the server's ability to handle concurrent requests effectively.

Investigate backend server/application: Analyze the backend server logs and metrics to identify any issues that might have contributed to the request failures. Check for resource constraints, performance bottlenecks, and database connectivity problems. Collaborate with the backend team to address and resolve any identified issues.

Strengthen logging and monitoring capabilities: Enhance the logging and monitoring infrastructure to capture detailed information about the web server's performance and errors. Enable logging of relevant Nginx modules and application logs. Set up alerts and notifications to proactively identify and address
